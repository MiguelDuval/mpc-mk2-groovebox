# Session State — MPC MkII Groovebox

**Checkpoint date:** 2026-10-21  
**Purpose:** handoff checkpoint; reconcile mutable status to exact-SHA evidence.

## Latest verification state — isolated SAMP-010 evidence fix

- PR #29 is draft on `feature/samp010-zoom-audition-acceptance`. Build #3049 / run `39672208687` at SHA `816e11a70a1368d63d0137c72aa4154774c5de7b` recorded successful SAMP-010 zoom-in 10–90%, zoom-out/RESET 0–100%, unchanged native sample region/frame getters, and the Pad-01 native audition marker. The overall workflow then failed in the shared Project Menu UI hierarchy dump.
- Post-run artifact inspection found an **evidence-pairing defect**: `sample-zoom-in.png` visibly showed VIEW 10–90%, but its same-named XML had subsequently been overwritten by the later ZOOM− operation and described VIEW 0–100%. There was no dedicated zoom-out screenshot. Runtime actions did occur; the saved milestone evidence was not complete/matched, so SAMP-010 evidence is not yet accepted.
- Isolated fix: use separate zoom-out XML/PNG paths and a separate pre-RESET zoomed XML; never overwrite the first zoom-in snapshot. The test now keeps exact viewport assertions per immutable state and adds zoom-out PNG to mandatory evidence checks. The Project Menu capture also uses bounded compressed XML but still fails on missing/malformed XML rather than silently accepting it.
- Primary PR #23 is independently testing the same Project Menu compressed-dump experiment on SHA `a593becb5f0259275b5b20b157edae3815f2729b`, Build #3051 / run `39677805700`. Do not integrate this draft PR into primary while its whole workflow is red.
- PR #28 current SHA `d0eef888e33ef98d5a64ce05a2409672f6b6e763`, Build #3050 / run `39672408316`, failed at the shared Project Menu hierarchy stage after Favorite assignment/restoration; native Project state/persistence tests passed. Project SAF lifecycle remains pending.

## Current queue — 2026-10-21

1. Run the isolated SAMP-010 evidence-preservation fix on a new exact SHA. Inspect every zoom-in/zoom-out/reset/audition PNG and XML pair after the full run.
2. Verify the compressed Project Menu XML capture on the primary PR #23 SHA and sync the common fix only after its result.
3. After the primary Project Menu checkpoint succeeds, continue the existing real Project SAVE/SAVE AS/OPEN acceptance; don't confuse native unit-test pass with full SAF lifecycle acceptance.

## Completed in this session

### 1. Track Edit sample-layer tuning — VERIFIED

The TUNE row is below the initial viewport inside the real Samples `ScrollView`. Live-bound scrolling exposes TUNE+, the test performs one real touch, verifies `+0.00 st → +1.00 st` against authoritative sampler state, exits/re-enters the actual route, confirms persistence, then restores the original value.

### 2. Main left Channel Strip geometry — FIXED / VERIFIED

The old condensed mixer was a duplicate weighted child re-exposed by saved Mixer visibility. It remains mounted but GONE to preserve refresh/state dependencies and shell visibility wiring. Live hierarchy checks confirm the XL strips fill the Main left region with the legacy panel absent.

### 3. Grid DRAW/ERASE — VERIFIED

A real emulator touch adds Pad 01 / Step 34 at velocity 100, ERASE removes the temporary note, and the seeded Step 33 note remains intact. The selected-cell accessibility projection is read from native sequencer state.

### 4. Step Sequencer touch/edit/remove — VERIFIED

Real emulator touches add Pad 01 / Step 02, adjust probability through the actual PARAM and decrement controls from 127 to 126, then erase the temporary event. Step 01 is unchanged; native cleanup and the parameter-selector restore pass.

### 5. Arrangement loop-brace touch/restore — VERIFIED

The real external drag changed the loop end from bar 4 to bar 3, and a second real drag restored bar 4. Native loop state and the application-side release handshake passed.

### 6. Arrangement event MOVE ± GRID — IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED

The Canvas event projection now carries each MIDI note number from the native model. A single tap identifies the event; EVENT − / EVENT + move it one current quantize-grid interval earlier/later via a native Pattern mutation. The native operation rejects invalid/out-of-range/colliding destinations, preserves duration/velocity/probability/ratchet/nudge, and records undo/redo in the existing edit history. The UI reloads and verifies the native event projection after mutation.

The full emulator smoke used a real canvas touch to select Track 01 / Note 036 at tick 7680, tapped EVENT + to reach tick 7920, then EVENT − to restore tick 7680. Before/moved/restored screenshots and matching accessibility hierarchies were inspected. The native Pattern operation tests and Arrangement projection JUnit tests passed as part of Build #2781.

### 7. Arrangement DUP / COPY / PASTE / CUT + canonical Function Bar — VERIFIED

DUP/COPY/PASTE/CUT are backed by native Pattern operations and native edit history, surfaced from the canonical bottom Function Bar. Event-only actions require a real event selection; PASTE additionally requires valid native clipboard state. UNDO/REDO and EVENT ± GRID remain in the secondary action row.

Build #2791 performed real touches and verified DUP → UNDO → REDO → UNDO, COPY → PASTE → UNDO → REDO → UNDO, and CUT → UNDO → REDO → UNDO against exact native Pattern state. Its full workflow passed all 57 steps, and its APK/evidence artifacts were inspected.

### 8. Arrangement empty-timeline paste cursor — IMPLEMENTED / VERIFIED

Build #2793 verified an actual empty-timeline touch at tick 240. The snapped cursor has its own state (not a fabricated event selection), shows a cyan marker and accessible Track/tick label, leaves the native Pattern unchanged, and enables PASTE only while a valid cursor and native clipboard coexist. After PASTE, note duration, pitch, velocity, probability, ratchet and nudge are preserved; UNDO restores the cursor and prior CUT Pattern, REDO recreates the event, and final UNDO CUT restores the exact fixture.

Verified by [Android Build #2793](https://github.com/MiguelDuval/mpc-mk2-groovebox/actions/runs/39075574304) on code SHA [`f49748de9db450ffc3b3b781befac99916f2a134`](https://github.com/MiguelDuval/mpc-mk2-groovebox/commit/f49748de9db450ffc3b3b781befac99916f2a134). All 57 workflow steps passed. The exact APK and visual-evidence archives were downloaded and integrity-checked; cursor/pasted/final-restored screenshots and accessibility XML were inspected.

Historical note superseded on 2026-10-18: explicit Pattern placements and their place/move/split/delete/duplicate operations are now implemented and emulator-verified. The open gap is project file save/reload through the Android user workflow.

### 9. MPC Studio MkII protocol/support/tutorial traceability — DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE / VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS NOT FULLY REVIEWED

Created [MPC-STUDIO-MKII-REVERSE-ENGINEERING-TRACEABILITY.md](MPC-STUDIO-MKII-REVERSE-ENGINEERING-TRACEABILITY.md). It documents the full pad-note map, 39 button/input mappings, Jog Wheel/Touch Strip input, button LED CC semantics, RGB pad SysEx, the six-chunk 160×80 LCD transport, corresponding source files/tests, and a physical validation queue. It links the primary community reverse-engineering repository, its Go/JavaScript LCD proof-of-concepts, official Akai FAQ and troubleshooting guide, the manufacturer-authored Quickstart mirror, and the official Akai-linked Academy/Masterclass playlists. Only hardware-level facts are retained; MPC Desktop, plug-in, licensing and DAW workflows are explicitly excluded.

The official playlists could not be fully transcript-audited through the available source view, so the document labels them indexed but not fully reviewed. It does not invent video findings. Hardware doc/semantic-map status summaries were reconciled; agent instructions and the operating protocol now require traceability before controller work. No app/runtime code was changed in this documentation slice. The current exact-HEAD workflow result still requires a live check.

## Current execution order — 2026-10-21

1. Re-run primary FAVORITE 1 with dual-format `ps` fallback and explicit runner PID diagnostics; inspect real picker root screenshot/XML and keep grant/restore assertions strict.
2. Check isolated exact-SHA Builds #3043 (SAMP-010) and #3044 (Project malformed-load unit regression) before moving either branch again.
3. After Favorite 1 passes, validate full Project SAVE/SAVE AS/OPEN lifecycle; integrate SAMP-010 only once its own acceptance and primary gates are green.
4. Physical MPC Studio MkII testing remains a separate pending gate.

## Mandatory operating rules

- `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PROJECT_MASTER_PROMPT.md`, and `docs/DEVELOPMENT-OPERATING-PROTOCOL.md` govern all agents.
- The dated queue at the top of `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md` is the immediate task order. Older dated notes are historical, not a current claim.
- One writer per branch: do not have Cline and ChatGPT mutate the same branch or files simultaneously. Parallel work is allowed only on isolated branches/worktrees with explicit file ownership and sequential integration.
- Start with targeted checks; perform full exact-HEAD CI and inspect real APK/evidence artifacts at the acceptance boundary.
- A build is not accepted on source inspection, a previous SHA, a screenshot alone, or a green targeted test.
- Never modify `main`, reset/rebase/rewrite history, force-push or merge PR #23 as part of routine work.
- Preserve existing audio/MIDI/sampler/sequencer boundaries. Never trade genuine acceptance coverage for a green workflow.

## Historical notes

The prior long-form checkpoint has been preserved in `docs/SESSION-HISTORY-ARCHIVE.md`. Read it only for a specific regression/history investigation, and verify any claim against live evidence.
